SiwaVerb
========

Conjugates the verb of Siwa Berber in its three stems. Takes the aorist (without the automatic vowels) as its input.

Originally based on generative rules of the imperfective shared with me by Lameen Souag. I've converted the rules to Python to test them, found some problems, moved them around a bit. Moreover, added a function to conjugate the perfective, and to insert the automatic Shwa.
